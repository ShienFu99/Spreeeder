Grapefruit was a courier working for some usurper dude ruling some backwater city and another city he doesn't actually control (control by merchants and religious dudes who didn't pay taxes), eitherway Grapefruit was sent to go find someoneelse who was like the chosen one but got sidetracked by assassins, so Grapefruit decpatated the assassins and sent their heads to whoever sent them (idk) and got the chosen one to whoever. Written by a wise author.
