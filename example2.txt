Tangerine was born in Penpal. He stole money from everyone and bought the entire Earth. He also started a museum; oh wait that's the wrong draft... His story was long and boring until he went to Mutton, then he died. The end. *Btw, he learned to stop comparing oranges and apples (he hates them equally).
