# Spreeeder / A free ripoff of Spreeder

## A program designed to improve reading speed

Program description

## Ideas:
- Use a graphical interface (customtkinter)
- Include sample files with text
- Allow user to input a weblink -> scrape the text and print it out
- Allow the user to specify the speed at which words are displayed
- Allow the user to copy and paste text to be read out




A white screen with large text displayed
-> User settings -> Choose number of words to display per frame
                 -> Choose speed at which frames load in


Start program in backend using terminal
1. Have a file with sample text in it
2. Read file and save the input as separate words based on whitespace -> Save into list
3. Print sequentially -> while list != EMPTY, clear all text on terminal, print x words, where x is the number specified by the user
    -> repeat until list is empty
4. Use sleep() function to establish intervals
